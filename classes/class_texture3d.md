**Inherited By:** `CompressedTexture3D<class_CompressedTexture3D>`,
`ImageTexture3D<class_ImageTexture3D>`,
`NoiseTexture3D<class_NoiseTexture3D>`,
`PlaceholderTexture3D<class_PlaceholderTexture3D>`,
`Texture3DRD<class_Texture3DRD>`

Base class for 3-dimensional textures.

classref-introduction-group

## Description

Base class for `ImageTexture3D<class_ImageTexture3D>` and
`CompressedTexture3D<class_CompressedTexture3D>`. Cannot be used
directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing the
derived resource types. **Texture3D** is the base class for all
3-dimensional texture types. See also
`TextureLayered<class_TextureLayered>`.

All images need to have the same width, height and number of mipmap
levels.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using
the Godot Editor import presets.

## Method Descriptions

classref-method

`Array<class_Array>`\[`Image<class_Image>`\] **\_get\_data**()
`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_private_method__get_data>`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s data is queried.

`int<class_int>` **\_get\_width**()
`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_private_method__get_width>`

Called when the **Texture3D**'s width is queried.

`bool<class_bool>` **\_has\_mipmaps**()
`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_private_method__has_mipmaps>`

Called when the presence of mipmaps in the **Texture3D** is queried.

classref-method

`Resource<class_Resource>` **create\_placeholder**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_method_create_placeholder>`

Creates a placeholder version of this resource
(`PlaceholderTexture3D<class_PlaceholderTexture3D>`).

classref-method

`Array<class_Array>`\[`Image<class_Image>`\] **get\_data**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_method_get_data>`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s data as an array of `Image<class_Image>`s.
Each `Image<class_Image>` represents a *slice* of the **Texture3D**,
with different slices mapping to different depth (Z axis) levels.

`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_method_get_depth>`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s depth in pixels. Depth is typically
represented by the Z axis (a dimension not present in
`Texture2D<class_Texture2D>`).

`int<class_int>` **get\_width**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Texture3D_method_get_width>`

Returns the **Texture3D**'s width in pixels. Width is typically
represented by the X axis.
