## Cause

A delegate annotated with the `[Signal]` attribute has a name that
doesn't end with 'EventHandler'.

## Rule description

Godot source generators will generate C# events using the name of the
delegate with the 'EventHandler' suffix removed. Adding the
'EventHandler' suffix to the name of delegates used in events is a [.NET
naming
convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-classes-structs-and-interfaces#names-of-common-types).

Using a suffix for the delegate allows the generated event to use the
name without the suffix avoiding a naming conflict.

    // This delegate is invalid since the name doesn't end with 'EventHandler'.
    [Signal]
    public void InvalidSignal();

    // This delegate is valid since the name ends with 'EventHandler'.
    [Signal]
    public void ValidSignalEventHandler();

Take a look at the `C# signals <doc_c_sharp_signals>` documentation for
more information about how to declare and use signals.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add 'EventHandler' to the end of the
delegate name.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Signal delegates without the
suffix will be ignored by the source generator, so the signal won't be
registered.
