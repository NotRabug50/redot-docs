## Cause

A script file contains multiple types that derives from `GodotObject`
with a name that matches the script file. Only one type in the script
file should match the file name.

## Rule description

Godot requires scripts to have a unique path so every type must be
defined on its own file and the type name must match the file name.

    public partial class MyNode : Node { }

    namespace DifferentNamespace
    {
        // Invalid because there's already a type with the name MyNode in this file.
        public partial class MyNode : Node { }
    }

    // Invalid because there's already a type with the name MyNode in this file.
    public partial class MyNode<T> : Node { }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, move each type declaration to a
different file.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Types that derive from
`GodotObject` must have a unique path otherwise the engine can't load
the script by path, resulting in unexpected runtime errors.
