## Cause

A type that derives from `GodotObject` is not declared partial.

## Rule description

Godot source generators add generated code to user-defined types to
implement the integration with the engine. Source generators can't add
generated code to types that aren't declared partial.

    // The source generators can't enhance this type to work with Godot.
    public class InvalidNode : Node { }

    // The source generators can enhance this type to work with Godot.
    public partial class ValidNode { }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `partial` keyword to the type
declaration.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Types that derive from
`GodotObject` but aren't partial can't be enhanced by the source
generators, resulting in unexpected runtime errors.
