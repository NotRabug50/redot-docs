## Cause

A type that doesn't derive from `Node` contains an exported field or
property of a type that derives from `Node`.

## Rule description

Exported nodes are serialized as `NodePath`. Only types derived from
`Node` are able to get the node instance from the `NodePath`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, avoid exporting `Node` members on a
type that doesn't derive from `Node`, or consider exporting a
`NodePath`.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Types that don't derive from
`Node` will be unable to retrieve the right node instance for exported
`Node` members, resulting in unexpected runtime errors.
