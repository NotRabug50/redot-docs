## Cause

A read-only member is annotated with the `[Export]` attribute. Read-only
members can't be exported.

## Rule description

Godot doesn't allow exporting read-only members.

    // Read-only fields can't be exported.
    [Export]
    public readonly int invalidField;

    // This field can be exported because it's not declared 'readonly'.
    [Export]
    public int validField;

    // Read-only properties can't be exported.
    [Export]
    public int InvalidProperty { get; }

    // This property can be exported because it has both a getter and a setter.
    [Export]
    public int ValidProperty { get; set; }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule for fields, remove the `readonly`
keyword or remove the `[Export]` attribute.

To fix a violation of this rule for properties, make sure the property
declares both a getter and a setter, or remove the `[Export]` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Read-only members can't be
exported so they will be ignored by Godot, resulting in runtime errors.
