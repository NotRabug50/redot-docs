# Engine core and modules

The following pages are meant to introduce the global organization of
Godot Engine's source code, and give useful tips for extending and
fixing the engine on the C++ side.

**Getting started with Godot's source code**

This section covers the basics that you will encounter in (almost) every
source file.

**Extending Godot by modifying its source code**

This section covers what you can do by modifying Godot's C++ source
code.
