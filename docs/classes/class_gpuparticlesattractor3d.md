Abstract base class for 3D particle attractors.

classref-introduction-group

## Description

Particle attractors can be used to attract particles towards the
attractor's origin, or to push them away from the attractor's origin.

Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and
scaled during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of
attractors is also supported.

Attractors can be temporarily disabled by hiding them, or by setting
their `strength<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_strength>` to
`0.0`.

\*\*Note:\*\* Particle attractors only affect
`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>`, not
`CPUParticles3D<class_CPUParticles3D>`.

## Property Descriptions

classref-property

`float<class_float>` **attenuation** = `1.0`
`ðŸ”—<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_attenuation>`

classref-property-setget

-   `void (No return value.)` **set\_attenuation**(value:
    `float<class_float>`)
-   `float<class_float>` **get\_attenuation**()

The particle attractor's attenuation. Higher values result in more
gradual pushing of particles as they come closer to the attractor's
origin. Zero or negative values will cause particles to be pushed very
fast as soon as the touch the attractor's edges.

`int<class_int>` **cull\_mask** = `4294967295`
`ðŸ”—<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_cull_mask>`

classref-property-setget

-   `void (No return value.)` **set\_cull\_mask**(value:
    `int<class_int>`)
-   `int<class_int>` **get\_cull\_mask**()

The particle rendering layers
(`VisualInstance3D.layers<class_VisualInstance3D_property_layers>`) that
will be affected by the attractor. By default, all particles are
affected by an attractor.

After configuring particle nodes accordingly, specific layers can be
unchecked to prevent certain particles from being affected by
attractors. For example, this can be used if you're using an attractor
as part of a spell effect but don't want the attractor to affect
unrelated weather particles at the same position.

Particle attraction can also be disabled on a per-process material basis
by setting
`ParticleProcessMaterial.attractor_interaction_enabled<class_ParticleProcessMaterial_property_attractor_interaction_enabled>`
on the `GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>` node.

`float<class_float>` **directionality** = `0.0`
`ðŸ”—<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_directionality>`

classref-property-setget

-   `void (No return value.)` **set\_directionality**(value:
    `float<class_float>`)
-   `float<class_float>` **get\_directionality**()

Adjusts how directional the attractor is. At `0.0`, the attractor is not
directional at all: it will attract particles towards its center. At
`1.0`, the attractor is fully directional: particles will always be
pushed towards local -Z (or +Z if
`strength<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_strength>` is
negative).

\*\*Note:\*\* If
`directionality<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_directionality>`
is greater than `0.0`, the direction in which particles are pushed can
be changed by rotating the **GPUParticlesAttractor3D** node.

`float<class_float>` **strength** = `1.0`

classref-property-setget

-   `void (No return value.)` **set\_strength**(value:
    `float<class_float>`)
-   `float<class_float>` **get\_strength**()

Adjusts the strength of the attractor. If
`strength<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_strength>` is negative,
particles will be pushed in the opposite direction. Particles will be
pushed *away* from the attractor's origin if
`directionality<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_directionality>`
is `0.0`, or towards local +Z if
`directionality<class_GPUParticlesAttractor3D_property_directionality>`
is greater than `0.0`.
