**&lt;** `Resource<class_Resource>` **&lt;**
`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **&lt;** `Object<class_Object>`

A single texture resource which consists of multiple, separate images.
Each image has the same dimensions and number of mipmap levels.

## Description

A Texture2DArray is different from a Texture3D: The Texture2DArray does
not support trilinear interpolation between the `Image<class_Image>`s,
i.e. no blending. See also `Cubemap<class_Cubemap>` and
`CubemapArray<class_CubemapArray>`, which are texture arrays with
specialized cubemap functions.

A Texture2DArray is also different from an
`AtlasTexture<class_AtlasTexture>`: In a Texture2DArray, all images are
treated separately. In an atlas, the regions (i.e. the single images)
can be of different sizes. Furthermore, you usually need to add a
padding around the regions, to prevent accidental UV mapping to more
than one region. The same goes for mipmapping: Mipmap chains are handled
separately for each layer. In an atlas, the slicing has to be done
manually in the fragment shader.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using
the Godot Editor import presets.
