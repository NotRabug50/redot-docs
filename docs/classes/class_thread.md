**Inherits:** `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **&lt;**
`Object<class_Object>`

A unit of execution in a process.

classref-introduction-group

## Description

A unit of execution in a process. Can run methods on
`Object<class_Object>`s simultaneously. The use of synchronization via
`Mutex<class_Mutex>` or `Semaphore<class_Semaphore>` is advised if
working with shared objects.

\*\*Warning:\*\*

To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, when a
**Thread**'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed,
the following conditions must be met:

-   It must not have any `Mutex<class_Mutex>` objects locked.
-   It must not be waiting on any `Semaphore<class_Semaphore>` objects.
-   `wait_to_finish<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>` should have
    been called on it.

## Enumerations

classref-enumeration

enum **Priority**: `ðŸ”—<enum_Thread_Priority>`

classref-enumeration-constant

`Priority<enum_Thread_Priority>` **PRIORITY\_LOW** = `0`

A thread running with lower priority than normally.

classref-enumeration-constant

`Priority<enum_Thread_Priority>` **PRIORITY\_NORMAL** = `1`

A thread with a standard priority.

classref-enumeration-constant

`Priority<enum_Thread_Priority>` **PRIORITY\_HIGH** = `2`

A thread running with higher priority than normally.

## Method Descriptions

classref-method

`String<class_String>` **get\_id**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_get_id>`

Returns the current **Thread**'s ID, uniquely identifying it among all
threads. If the **Thread** has not started running or if
`wait_to_finish<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>` has been called,
this returns an empty string.

classref-method

`bool<class_bool>` **is\_alive**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_is_alive>`

Returns `true` if this **Thread** is currently running the provided
function. This is useful for determining if
`wait_to_finish<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>` can be called
without blocking the calling thread.

To check if a **Thread** is joinable, use
`is_started<class_Thread_method_is_started>`.

classref-method

`bool<class_bool>` **is\_started**()
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_is_started>`

Returns `true` if this **Thread** has been started. Once started, this
will return `true` until it is joined using
`wait_to_finish<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>`. For checking if a
**Thread** is still executing its task, use
`is_alive<class_Thread_method_is_alive>`.

classref-method

`void (No return value.)`
**set\_thread\_safety\_checks\_enabled**(enabled: `bool<class_bool>`)
`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_set_thread_safety_checks_enabled>`

Sets whether the thread safety checks the engine normally performs in
methods of certain classes (e.g., `Node<class_Node>`) should happen **on
the current thread**.

The default, for every thread, is that they are enabled (as if called
with `enabled` being `true`).

Those checks are conservative. That means that they will only succeed in
considering a call thread-safe (and therefore allow it to happen) if the
engine can guarantee such safety.

Because of that, there may be cases where the user may want to disable
them (`enabled` being `false`) to make certain operations allowed again.
By doing so, it becomes the user's responsibility to ensure thread
safety (e.g., by using `Mutex<class_Mutex>`) for those objects that are
otherwise protected by the engine.

\*\*Note:\*\* This is an advanced usage of the engine. You are advised
to use it only if you know what you are doing and there is no safer way.

\*\*Note:\*\* This is useful for scripts running on either arbitrary
**Thread** objects or tasks submitted to the
`WorkerThreadPool<class_WorkerThreadPool>`. It doesn't apply to code
running during `Node<class_Node>` group processing, where the checks
will be always performed.

\*\*Note:\*\* Even in the case of having disabled the checks in a
`WorkerThreadPool<class_WorkerThreadPool>` task, there's no need to
re-enable them at the end. The engine will do so.

classref-method

`Error<enum_@GlobalScope_Error>` **start**(callable:
`Callable<class_Callable>`, priority: `Priority<enum_Thread_Priority>`
= 1) `ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_start>`

Starts a new **Thread** that calls `callable`.

If the method takes some arguments, you can pass them using
`Callable.bind<class_Callable_method_bind>`.

The `priority` of the **Thread** can be changed by passing a value from
the `Priority<enum_Thread_Priority>` enum.

Returns `@GlobalScope.OK<class_@GlobalScope_constant_OK>` on success, or
`@GlobalScope.ERR_CANT_CREATE<class_@GlobalScope_constant_ERR_CANT_CREATE>`
on failure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

classref-method

`Variant<class_Variant>` **wait\_to\_finish**()
`ðŸ”—<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>`

Joins the **Thread** and waits for it to finish. Returns the output of
the `Callable<class_Callable>` passed to
`start<class_Thread_method_start>`.

Should either be used when you want to retrieve the value returned from
the method called by the **Thread** or before freeing the instance that
contains the **Thread**.

To determine if this can be called without blocking the calling thread,
check if `is_alive<class_Thread_method_is_alive>` is `false`.
