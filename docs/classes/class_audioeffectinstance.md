## Description

An audio effect instance manipulates the audio it receives for a given
effect. This instance is automatically created by an
`AudioEffect<class_AudioEffect>` when it is added to a bus, and should
usually not be created directly. If necessary, it can be fetched at
run-time with
`AudioServer.get_bus_effect_instance<class_AudioServer_method_get_bus_effect_instance>`.

## Method Descriptions

classref-method

`void (No return value.)` **\_process**(src\_buffer: `const void*`,
dst\_buffer: `AudioFrame*`, frame\_count: `int<class_int>`)
`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_AudioEffectInstance_private_method__process>`

Called by the `AudioServer<class_AudioServer>` to process this effect.
When
`_process_silence<class_AudioEffectInstance_private_method__process_silence>`
is not overridden or it returns `false`, this method is called only when
the bus is active.

\*\*Note:\*\* It is not useful to override this method in GDScript or
C#. Only GDExtension can take advantage of it.

classref-method

`bool<class_bool>` **\_process\_silence**()
`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
`ðŸ”—<class_AudioEffectInstance_private_method__process_silence>`

Override this method to customize the processing behavior of this effect
instance.

Should return `true` to force the `AudioServer<class_AudioServer>` to
always call
`_process<class_AudioEffectInstance_private_method__process>`, even if
the bus has been muted or cannot otherwise be heard.
