Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a
skybox.

## Description

A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically
used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see
`ReflectionProbe<class_ReflectionProbe>`). It can be used to make an
object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually
delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.

This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core
Godot methods make use of **Cubemap** resources.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using
the Godot Editor import presets.

\*\*Note:\*\* Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a
`PanoramaSkyMaterial<class_PanoramaSkyMaterial>`. You can use [this
tool](https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html)
to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map.
