# TextureLayered

**Inherits:** `Texture<class_Texture>` **&lt;**
`Resource<class_Resource>` **&lt;** `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`
**&lt;** `Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:**
`CompressedTextureLayered<class_CompressedTextureLayered>`,
`ImageTextureLayered<class_ImageTextureLayered>`,
`PlaceholderTextureLayered<class_PlaceholderTextureLayered>`,
`TextureLayeredRD<class_TextureLayeredRD>`

Base class for texture types which contain the data of multiple
`Image<class_Image>`s. Each image is of the same size and format.

classref-introduction-group

## Description

Base class for `ImageTextureLayered<class_ImageTextureLayered>` and
`CompressedTextureLayered<class_CompressedTextureLayered>`. Cannot be
used directly, but contains all the functions necessary for accessing
the derived resource types. See also `Texture3D<class_Texture3D>`.

Data is set on a per-layer basis. For
`Texture2DArray<class_Texture2DArray>`s, the layer specifies the array
layer.

All images need to have the same width, height and number of mipmap
levels.

A **TextureLayered** can be loaded with
`ResourceLoader.load<class_ResourceLoader_method_load>`.

Internally, Godot maps these files to their respective counterparts in
the target rendering driver (Vulkan, OpenGL3).
