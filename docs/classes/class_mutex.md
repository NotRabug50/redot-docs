# Mutex

**Inherits:** `RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **&lt;**
`Object<class_Object>`

A binary `Semaphore<class_Semaphore>` for synchronization of multiple
`Thread<class_Thread>`s.

classref-introduction-group

## Description

A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize
multiple `Thread<class_Thread>`s, and is equivalent to a binary
`Semaphore<class_Semaphore>`. It guarantees that only one thread can
access a critical section at a time.

This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times
by one thread, provided it also unlocks it as many times.

\*\*Warning:\*\* Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.

\*\*Warning:\*\* To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks,
the following conditions must be met:

-   When a **Mutex**'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore
    destroyed, no threads (including the one on which the destruction
    will happen) must have it locked.
-   When a `Thread<class_Thread>`'s reference count reaches zero and it
    is therefore destroyed, it must not have any mutex locked.

## Method Descriptions

classref-method

`void (No return value.)` **lock**() `ðŸ”—<class_Mutex_method_lock>`

Locks this **Mutex**, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.

\*\*Note:\*\* This function returns without blocking if the thread
already has ownership of the mutex.

classref-item-separator

------------------------------------------------------------------------

classref-method

`bool<class_bool>` **try\_lock**() `ðŸ”—<class_Mutex_method_try_lock>`

Tries locking this **Mutex**, but does not block. Returns `true` on
success, `false` otherwise.

\*\*Note:\*\* This function returns `true` if the thread already has
ownership of the mutex.

classref-item-separator

------------------------------------------------------------------------

classref-method

`void (No return value.)` **unlock**() `ðŸ”—<class_Mutex_method_unlock>`

Unlocks this **Mutex**, leaving it to other threads.

\*\*Note:\*\* If a thread called `lock<class_Mutex_method_lock>` or
`try_lock<class_Mutex_method_try_lock>` multiple times while already
having ownership of the mutex, it must also call
`unlock<class_Mutex_method_unlock>` the same number of times in order to
unlock it correctly.

\*\*Warning:\*\* Calling `unlock<class_Mutex_method_unlock>` more times
that `lock<class_Mutex_method_lock>` on a given thread, thus ending up
trying to unlock a non-locked mutex, is wrong and may causes crashes or
deadlocks.
