# User interface (UI)

In this section of the tutorial we explain the basics of creating a
graphical user interface (GUI) in Godot.

## UI building blocks

Like everything else in Godot the user interface is built using nodes,
specifically `Control <class_Control>` nodes. There are many different
types of controls which are useful for creating specific types of GUIs.
For simplicity we can separate them into two groups: content and layout.

Typical content controls include:

-   `Buttons <class_Button>`
-   `Labels <class_Label>`
-   `LineEdits <class_LineEdit>` and `TextEdits <class_TextEdit>`

Typical layout controls include:

-   `BoxContainers <class_BoxContainer>`
-   `MarginContainers <class_MarginContainer>`
-   `ScrollContainers <class_ScrollContainer>`
-   `TabContainers <class_TabContainer>`
-   `Popups <class_Popup>`

The following pages explain the basics of using such controls.

## GUI skinning and themes

Godot features an in-depth skinning/theming system for control nodes.
The pages in this section explain the benefits of that system and how to
set it up in your projects.
