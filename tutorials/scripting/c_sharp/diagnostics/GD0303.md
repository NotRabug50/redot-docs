## Cause

This is a bug in the engine and must be reported.

## Rule description

The `MustBeVariantAnalyzer` has found an unhandled case in the user
source code. Please, open an
[issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) and attach a
minimal reproduction project so it can be fixed.

## How to fix violations

Violations of this rule can't be fixed.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppressing a warning from this rule may result in unexpected errors,
since the case found by the analyzer may need to be handled by the user
to prevent types that are not Variant-compatible from reaching the
engine. Attempting to marshal incompatible types will result in runtime
errors.
