## Cause

A type that derives from `GodotObject` is contained in a non-partial
type declaration.

## Rule description

Godot source generators add generated code to user-defined types to
implement the integration with the engine. Source generators can't add
generated code to types that aren't declared partial.

    public class InvalidParentType
    {
        // MyNode is contained in a non-partial type so the source generators
        // can't enhance this type to work with Godot.
        public partial class MyNode : Node { }
    }

    public partial class ValidParentType
    {
        // MyNode is contained in a partial type so the source generators
        // can enhance this type to work with Godot.
        public partial class MyNode : Node { }
    }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `partial` keyword to the type
declaration.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Types that derive from
`GodotObject` but aren't partial can't be enhanced by the source
generators, resulting in unexpected runtime errors.
