## Cause

An indexer is annotated with the `[Export]` attribute. Indexers can't be
exported.

## Rule description

Godot doesn't allow exporting indexer properties.

    private int[] _backingField;

    // Indexers can't be exported.
    [Export]
    public int this[int index]
    {
        get => _backingField[index];
        set => _backingField[index] = value;
    }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the `[Export]` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Indexers can't be exported so
they will be ignored by Godot, resulting in runtime errors.
