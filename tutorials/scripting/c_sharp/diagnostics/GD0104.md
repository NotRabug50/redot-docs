## Cause

A write-only property is annotated with the `[Export]` attribute.
Write-only properties can't be exported.

## Rule description

Godot doesn't allow exporting write-only properties.

    private int _backingField;

    // Write-only properties can't be exported.
    [Export]
    public int InvalidProperty { set => _backingField = value; }

    // This property can be exported because it has both a getter and a setter.
    [Export]
    public int ValidProperty { get; set; }

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, make sure the property declares both a
getter and a setter, or remove the `[Export]` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Write-only members can't be
exported so they will be ignored by Godot, resulting in runtime errors.
